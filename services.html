    <h2>Programme and Organisational Design</h2>
    <p>Since 2004, BALA Consulting has provided significant strategic planning support to UNICEF Country Offices (COs) to develop and adjust Country Programmes - drafting Country Programme Documents (CPDs), Country Programme Action Plans (CPAPs), Mid Term Reviews (MTRs), Rolling Work Plans (RWPS), Resource Mobilisation Strategies and Annual Reports.

This has also included facilitating at MTR, Strategic Visioning, Results Based Management, Country Programme Development and Rolling Work Plan workshops and attending other key bilateral meetings.

    <h2>Evaluation and Assessment</h2	>
   <p>BALA Consulting provides support to UN agencies in evaluating country, sub regional and regional programmes documenting best practices, challenges and lessons learnt, including looking at humanitarian situations, such as Indian Ocean Tsunami (2004) and Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar (2008). It adheres to commonly agreed OECD/DAC and Evaluation Association norms and standards to ensure ownership by stakeholders. It has undertaken a number of reviews of country programmes analysing how in reality Country and Regional Offices are implementing programme and advocacy strategies and more recently how the refocus on equity is addressing government development needs beyond UN programming. Examples of assessments undertaken include: East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) - Child Trafficking; EAP – UN Coherence; EAP – Evaluation of Donor Reporting Management and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) - Sub Regional Advisor Mechanism. These reviews also included assessing the currently available tools and technical guidance that are provided globally, regionally and sub regionally by UNICEF and whether they are sufficient and applicable to address differing programming needs going forward, given the new equity approach.</p>
